#import ardata from Ambulatory/Neurology/Data from CHP in box


The 4 V's
Volume- The dataset "ardata" has 504 obsevations with 15 variables.

Velocity-Every row corresponds to a single session (AM or PM) of that perticular date. The    entire dataset contains 251 afternoon sessions and 253 morning sessions. 
Every new input of a  morning and afternoon session of the same date will add another day to the data.Currently, the data has 252 days.

Variety- The dataset has been derived from the following sources:
         "Neurology FY17",Location: Box/Ambulatory/Neurology/Data From CHP/Cadence Data
         "Neurology Rent Grid", Location: Box/Ambulatory/Neurology/Data From CHP/Cadence Data
         Information in categories of â€“ Number of Rooms, Day of the Week, Date etc 
Veracity- Sessions not sequenced by  Date and should be sorted before analyzing trends with 
          respect to Appointment Date.

Summary by Session:

Steps:
1. Mutate an Indicator Function for every Session based on the differences between Rented and 
  Staffed Rooms-
   Release Room Indicator-For every session which has a difference between Rented and Staffed 
                          Rooms greater than or equal to 3, output 1 for every such session and 
                          0 otherwise.
   Need Room Indicator - For every session which has a difference between Staffed and Rented 
                          Rooms greater than or equal to 2, output 1 for every session and 0 
                          otherwise.
2.Group the dataset by Day of the Week and AM/PM Session.
3.Count the total number of Sessions for every group.
4.Count the total number of Sessions where Rented Rooms need to be released by summing the        entire column having the Release Room Indicator.
5.Count the total number of Sessions where Rented Rooms are needed by summing the entire 
  column having the Need Room Indicator.
6. Calculate the percent of Rooms Released by dividing the Total number of Sesssions where
   Rooms are released by the Total number of Sessions.
7. Calculate the percent of Rooms Needed by dividing the Total number of Sesssions where
   Rooms are needed by the Total number of Sessions.

Summary By Rooms:

Procedure:
1.Mutate number of Rented Rooms to release and in need based on the differences between Rented 
  and Staffed Rooms- 
  Released Rooms- If the difference between Rented and Rooms and Staffed Rooms is greater than
                   or equal to 3, Subtract 2 from the difference and the resultant would be the
                   number of Rented Rooms to be released.
  Rooms Needed- If the difference between Staffed Rooms and Rented Rooms is greater than or 
                equal to 2, the number of rooms needed would be the difference minus 1.
2. Group the dataset by Day of Week and AM/PM Session.
3. Count the total number of Staffed and Rented Rooms for every group.
4. Calculate the total number of Rooms to be Release for every group by summing the 'Released
   Rooms' for every group.
5. Calculate the total number of Rooms needed for every group by summing the
   Rooms Needed' for every group.
6.Calculate the percent of the rooms to be released by dividing the Total Number of Released
  Rooms by the Total number of Rented Rooms.
7. Calculate the total number of rooms needed by dividing the Total number of Rooms Needed 
  by the Total number of Rented Rooms.
